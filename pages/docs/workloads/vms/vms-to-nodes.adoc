Assigning VMs to Nodes
----------------------

You can constrain the VM to only run on specific nodes or to prefer
running on specific nodes:

* *nodeSelector*
* *Affinity and anti-affinity*

nodeSelector
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting `spec.nodeSelector` requirements, constrains the scheduler to
only schedule VMs on nodes, which contain the specified labels. In the
following example the vmi contains the labels `cpu: slow` and
`storage: fast`:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: testvmi-ephemeral
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    cpu: slow
    storage: fast
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
----

Thus the scheduler will only schedule the vmi to nodes which contain
these labels in their metadata. It works exactly like the Pods
`nodeSelector`. See the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector[Pod
nodeSelector Documentation] for more examples.

[[affinity-and-anti-affinity]]
Affinity and anti-affinity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `spec.affinity` field allows specifying hard- and soft-affinity for
VMs. It is possible to write matching rules agains workloads (VMs and
Pods) and Nodes. Since VMs are a workload type based on Pods,
Pod-affinity affects VMs as well.

An example for `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity` may look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: testvmi-ephemeral
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    cpu: slow
    storage: fast
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - S1
        topologyKey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: security
              operator: In
              values:
              - S2
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
----

Affinity and anti-affinity works exactly like the Pods `affinity`. This
includes `podAffinity`, `podAntiAffinity`, `nodeAffinity` and
`nodeAntiAffinity`. See the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity[Pod
affinity and anti-affinity Documentation] for more examples and details.
